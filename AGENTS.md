## Record deferred findings

- While working, file a GitHub issue in the owning repository for each
  confirmed, actionable defect or quality gap that cannot reasonably be
  fixed within the current task. Filing these issues is authorized; do not
  wait for a separate instruction for each finding.
- Search existing open issues first. Reuse the matching issue and add only
  new, useful evidence instead of creating a duplicate. Group findings only
  when they share a cause and can be resolved by one focused change.
- State the observed behavior, expected behavior, affected repository-relative
  paths, reproduction or inspection evidence, impact, and acceptance checks.
  Distinguish observations from hypotheses and specification requirements.
  Never claim an unexecuted test or hardware operation was verified.
- Keep speculative improvements in working notes until they have a concrete
  problem and useful acceptance criteria. Avoid issue spam and severity claims
  unsupported by evidence.
- Never put credentials, PIN data or candidate lengths, card secrets,
  personal data, private workspace paths, or persistent device identifiers
  in issue text, logs, screenshots, attachments, or reproduction fixtures.
  Report security-sensitive findings through the repository's private
  reporting process; if no safe channel is available, notify the user
  without publishing sensitive details.
- An issue does not excuse a broken gate or incomplete work needed to make
  the current task correct. Fix findings required for the task before handing
  it over; file independently deferred work with a clear scope.
- Link newly filed or reused issues in the task handoff. If issue creation is
  unavailable, preserve a sanitized finding locally and report that it was
  not filed; never silently discard it.
